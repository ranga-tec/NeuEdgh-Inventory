# ISS ERP System: Technical Maintainer Guide

## Purpose

This document is the navigation hub for future agents and developers working on the ISS ERP system.

It provides the high-level system context and points to the detailed guides for backend, frontend, and change workflows.

Use this hub first, then jump into the specialized docs linked below.

## Current Project Status (Practical Summary)

- Major ERP/service modules are implemented across backend + frontend.
- Line-level editing/deleting is now implemented across all draft document detail grids.
- Master-data list maintenance now includes row-level edit/delete actions and backend delete APIs.
- Master data now includes UoM conversions, payment types, taxes/tax conversions, currencies/rates, and reference forms.
- Reporting now includes costing in addition to dashboard, stock-ledger, aging, tax summary, and service KPIs.
- Inventory currently supports warehouse/bin/batch on-hand and availability visibility, stock-adjustment physical counts, stock-transfer move quantities, and signed stock-ledger history with batch/serial detail.
- Warehouse management now includes `WarehouseBin` master data for bin/rack/shelf locations. Existing stock without a bin is intentionally treated as `Unassigned` so older movements stay valid after migration.
- Procurement GRNs now support PO-linked partial receipt planning, duplicate-item PO line handling, early serial/batch validation, and searchable `Receive From PO` / `Current Draft Lines` tables.
- Service now supports `Service` and `Repair` job kinds, work-order labor entries/timesheets, estimate revisions, service-linked direct purchases, service expense claims, billable claim-to-estimate conversion, labor-to-invoice conversion, and per-job costing rollups.
- Finance now includes petty cash funds with opening balance, top-up, adjustment, and service expense-claim settlement flows.
- The authenticated shell sidebar now defaults to expanded navigation and exposes menu search at the top of the expanded panel.
- Multi-company foundation is implemented for login context and core C-COM master data: users have `CompanyId`, JWTs include `company_id`, and items/categories/suppliers are company-scoped. Full transaction-level company isolation is still future work.

## Stack and Runtime Topology

- Backend: ASP.NET Core (.NET 8), EF Core, PostgreSQL, ASP.NET Identity, JWT auth
- Frontend: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Database: PostgreSQL on the local machine (`localhost:5432` by default)
- Docs/file attachments: local filesystem storage under API `App_Data`
- Notifications: outbox-based email/SMS dispatch (SMTP/Twilio adapters, null senders when not configured)

Typical local runtime:

- Frontend (`localhost:3000`) -> Next.js proxy route -> Backend API (`localhost:5257`) -> PostgreSQL (`localhost:5432`)

## Implemented Functional Coverage Snapshot

- Master data:
  - items, brands, categories/subcategories, warehouses, warehouse bins/racks, suppliers, customers, reorder settings
  - UoMs, UoM conversions
  - taxes, tax conversions
  - currencies, currency rates
  - payment types, reference forms
  - row-level edit/delete actions on all master-data maintenance grids (items via edit panel)
- Procurement:
  - RFQ, purchase requisition, purchase order, goods receipt, direct purchase, supplier invoice, supplier return
- Sales:
  - quote, order, dispatch, direct dispatch, invoice, customer return
- Service:
  - equipment units, jobs, estimates, expense claims, work orders, material requisitions, quality checks, handovers
- Finance:
  - AR/AP, payments + allocations, petty cash funds, credit notes, debit notes
- Reporting:
  - dashboard, stock ledger, aging, tax summary, service KPIs, costing

## Repository Map

Repo root:

- `backend/`
- `frontend/`
- `docs/`
- `scripts/`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `ISS.slnx`

Backend source projects (`backend/src`):

- `ISS.Api` -> HTTP API, auth, controllers, middleware, health checks, hosted services
- `ISS.Application` -> application services, interfaces, options, validators

Backend tests (`backend/tests`):

- `ISS.UnitTests` -> domain/application unit tests
- `ISS.IntegrationTests` -> end-to-end API tests via in-process test host + PostgreSQL

Frontend (`frontend/src`):

- `app/` -> App Router routes (`(auth)` and `(app)` route groups)
- `components/` -> shared UI/components (including collaboration panel)
- `lib/` -> backend proxy fetch helpers, auth/session helpers, environment helpers
- `proxy.ts` -> route protection middleware/proxy logic (Next.js middleware entry)

Ops scripts:

- `scripts/ops/smoke-api.ps1` -> health/auth/basic API smoke checks (CI and post-deploy use)

## Suggested Usage (Future Agent)

1. Read `README.md` for local setup and run commands.
2. Read this hub doc for system scope and documentation map.
3. Read the relevant detailed guide(s) for the area you will change.
4. Implement one focused checkpoint with code + tests + docs updates together.
