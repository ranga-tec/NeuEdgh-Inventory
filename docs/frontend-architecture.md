## Frontend Architecture

### App Router Structure

Frontend routes are organized under `frontend/src/app` with route groups:

- `(auth)` -> login/registration flow
- `(app)` -> authenticated ERP UI (modules and detail pages)

Main module sections under `frontend/src/app/(app)`:

- `master-data`
- `procurement`
- `inventory`
- `sales`
- `service`
- `finance`
- `reporting`
- `admin`
- `audit-logs`

### Auth Flow and Route Protection

Key files:

- `frontend/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` (same pattern)
- `frontend/src/lib/env.ts`
- `frontend/src/lib/jwt.ts`
- `frontend/src/proxy.ts`

How it works:

- Frontend auth API routes call backend `/api/auth/*`
- JWT is stored in an HTTP-only cookie (`iss_token`)
- `proxy.ts` checks presence/expiry of JWT and redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- Session display in the app layout decodes JWT claims client-side/server-side using helper utilities

Notes:

- `proxy.ts` is the middleware/protection entry point in this project (not `middleware.ts`)
- Expired tokens are cleared and redirected to login

### Backend API Access Patterns (Frontend)

There are two main patterns. Use the correct one depending on component type.

Server components:

- use `backendFetchJson` from `frontend/src/lib/backend.server.ts`
- requests go directly to backend API base URL
- auth token is read from cookie and forwarded as Bearer token
- best for page-level data fetching on initial render

Client components:

- use `api-client.ts` helpers (`apiGet`, `apiPost`, `apiPostNoContent`, `apiPostForm`, etc.)
- requests go through `frontend/src/app/api/backend/[...path]/route.ts`
- proxy route forwards method/body, Bearer token from cookie, and only a safe allowlist of request headers
- preserves binary/content-disposition responses for downloads

Maintainer rule:

- Do not call backend API URLs directly from browser client components
- Use `api-client.ts` so auth/cookie/proxy behavior stays consistent

### UI Composition Pattern (Common and Recommended)

Typical page structure:

- page is a server component (`page.tsx`)
- page fetches DTOs via `backendFetchJson`
- page renders read-only tables/cards and includes small client components for actions/forms

Typical action component pattern:

- client component with `useState` for busy/error
- calls `apiPost`/`apiPostNoContent`
- redirects or refreshes after success

Representative examples:

- PR list/detail pages and action forms
- `DocumentCollaborationPanel` for comments/attachments
- inventory reorder alerts page + action button

### Document Collaboration in UI

Reusable UI component:

- `frontend/src/components/DocumentCollaborationPanel.tsx`

This component handles:

- loading comments/attachments
- adding/deleting comments
- uploading/deleting attachments
- rendering image previews and file links

When enabling collaboration on a new document screen:

1. Add the component to the detail page
2. Pass the correct `referenceType` and document `id`
3. Ensure the backend reference type is accepted by normalization rules
4. Verify auth roles for the target module

### Frontend Navigation

Sidebar lives in:

- `frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

When adding/removing modules or report pages:

- update sidebar links
- ensure page route exists
- verify role access (frontend may still render link even if backend denies)

### Cross-Document Navigation

Related document references should use the shared routing helpers instead of hardcoded cross-module URLs.

- Document-to-document links should resolve through `ReferenceForms` route templates so navigation stays aligned with the master-data route map.
- Server-rendered pages should use the shared transaction link helper rather than rebuilding route resolution ad hoc.
- Item references should deep-link into `Master Data -> Items` using the shared item-routing helper so users land on the dedicated item detail screen.

Maintainer rule:

- When adding a new transactional reference to the UI, prefer the shared link helpers first.
- When introducing a new document type, add or update its `ReferenceForm` route template so cross-navigation works everywhere consistently.

### Implemented Module Coverage (UI)

Master data pages include:

- brands, items, item categories/subcategories, warehouses, suppliers, customers, reorder settings
- UoMs, UoM conversions
- taxes, tax conversions
- currencies, currency rates
- payment types, reference forms

Transactional module pages include:

- procurement: RFQ, purchase requisition, PO, GRN, direct purchase, supplier invoice, supplier return
- sales: quote, order, dispatch, direct dispatch, invoice, customer return
- service: equipment units, service contracts, jobs, estimates, expense claims, work orders, material requisitions, quality checks, handovers
- inventory: on-hand, reorder alerts, stock adjustments, stock transfers
- finance: AR/AP, payments, petty cash, credit notes, debit notes
- reporting: dashboard, stock-ledger, aging, tax summary, service KPIs, costing

### Dashboard Standard

The authenticated home route (`/`) is now treated as an operational dashboard rather than a report landing page.

- all business roles can access the dashboard route
- dashboard data is permission-aware and only returns module sections the signed-in user can act on
- the page is organized as:
  - hero KPI cards
  - attention/exception alerts
  - role-specific work-queue sections
  - quick-access links
- if the dashboard API is temporarily unavailable, the page still renders fallback quick links instead of failing blank

Maintainer rule:

- keep `/` useful for day-to-day operators
- keep analytical report pages under `/reporting/*` restricted to `Admin` and `Reporting`
- when adding a new transactional module, extend the dashboard section/quick-action model instead of adding one-off homepage widgets

### Inventory UI Behavior

Current inventory interaction pattern:

- `Inventory Availability` provides the full searchable stock browser across item, warehouse, bin/rack, batch/lot, and serial
- `On Hand` remains the focused selected-item query and uses warehouse and batch breakdown rows instead of a single merged balance
- `Master Data -> Warehouses` includes bin/rack/shelf maintenance so warehouse locations are controlled as master data
- draft stock transaction pages reuse the shared stock visibility explorer and inline live stock widget
- stock adjustment lines are entered as `counted quantity`; the UI shows current system quantity and expected variance
- stock transfer lines are entered as `move quantity`; the source warehouse stock widget stays visible while editing
- stock ledger renders signed movement quantities plus batch and serial detail for history review

### Line Grid Action Standard (Draft Documents)

The detail pages for line-based documents use a common behavior:

- show `Add line` card only while the document is draft/editable
- show an `Actions` column in the line grid while draft
- each line row supports `Edit`, `Save/Cancel`, and `Delete`

This behavior is now applied across the draft document detail pages currently on the shared grid, while the remaining inventory/service/direct-purchase screens still use older per-row components with the same visible action pattern.

### Reusable Data Grid Framework

Transaction-line editing is now moving onto a shared frontend grid module:

- primary module path: `frontend/src/components/data-grid`
- compatibility shim: `frontend/src/components/EditableDataTable.tsx`

The framework exposes:

- typed column definitions for `display`, `text`, `number`, `money`, `percent`, `date`, `datetime`, `textarea`, `select`, and searchable `lookup`
- explicit row-submit support via `Enter`
- natural `Tab` movement through editable controls
- optional footer rows for visible totals and summaries

Current live rollout:

- GRN receipt-plan editing
- purchase-order line editing
- sales-invoice line editing
- sales-quote line editing
- sales-order line editing
- RFQ line editing
- purchase-requisition line editing
- dispatch line editing
- direct-dispatch line editing
- customer-return line editing
- supplier-return line editing

Maintainer rule:

- keep document validation and save logic outside the reusable grid
- keep lookup columns only for fields that the backend can really update
- prefer one primary working grid per document area rather than duplicating the same line set in multiple tables on the same screen

### Master Data Grid Action Standard

Master-data list pages now follow the same maintainability pattern:

- list table includes an `Actions` column
- each row supports `Edit`, `Save/Cancel`, and `Delete`
- errors are shown inline per row
- destructive actions use explicit confirmation prompts

This standard is now implemented across brands, customers, suppliers, warehouses, warehouse bins/racks, UoMs, UoM conversions, taxes, tax conversions, currencies, currency rates, payment types, reference forms, item categories/subcategories, and reorder settings.
Items now use a separate list/search page plus dedicated create, view, and edit pages. The item list grid exposes `View`, `Edit`, `Delete`, and item label links.

### Costing Reporting UI

Costing UI route:

- `/reporting/costing`

This page supports:

- warehouse/item filters
- default vs weighted average cost display
- last receipt cost/date display
- on-hand and inventory valuation totals in base currency

### Service And Finance Workflow UI

Recent workflow-specific UI behavior:

- the home dashboard now follows an industry-standard ERP pattern with exception alerts, operational queues, and role-aware quick links instead of a static four-card summary
- `/api/reporting/dashboard` is available to all business roles because it backs the authenticated home page, while the detailed reporting endpoints remain restricted to `Admin` and `Reporting`
- procurement list pages now expose explicit `View` / `Edit` actions for purchase requisitions, RFQs, purchase orders, goods receipts, direct purchases, supplier invoices, and supplier returns
- `Finance -> Chart of Accounts` now supports `Classic` and `Priority Grid` workspace modes for dense ERP-style maintenance
- finance item/category account mapping is surfaced in the item and item-category maintenance flows, while resolved account snapshots are displayed on invoice, direct-purchase, and service expense-claim lines
- procurement list-page `Edit` remains available while the document is still `Draft`
- sales list pages now expose explicit `View` / `Edit` actions for quotes, orders, dispatches, direct dispatches, invoices, and customer returns
- sales list-page `Edit` remains available while the document is still `Draft` (and follows existing invoice permissions)
- equipment-unit detail pages support warranty ownership updates and list linked service contracts
- equipment-unit creation supports `Existing item` and `Outside equipment` modes; outside equipment creates the Item Master equipment row and serialized unit together from the service screen
- sales Dispatch/AOD create screens capture warranty and service scheduling defaults used when posted serialized equipment lines create installed-base equipment units
- service-contract list/detail pages manage `AMC`, `SLA`, and warranty-extension coverage for installed units
- service-contract and service-job forms use the shared equipment-unit lookup; it displays `Item SKU - Item Name / SN: SerialNumber` and searches item SKU, item name, serial number, and customer code
- service-job create/detail screens surface entitlement source, coverage, billing treatment, and manual refresh when coverage changes
- service technician maintenance is exposed at `/service/technicians`; job detail labor entry forms use this master to populate technician, default cost rate, and billing rate
- service list pages now expose explicit `View` / `Edit` actions for contracts, equipment units, jobs, estimates, and expense claims
- service estimates support `Part`, `Labor`, and `Expense` line kinds, customer-approval state visibility, resend behavior on edited drafts, and explicit `Create Change Order` actions after approval/rejection
- service expense claim detail pages let service/finance users submit, approve/reject, settle, and convert billable claim lines into the working estimate
- service work-order detail pages support labor-entry capture plus submit/approve/reject actions, and show effective billable labor after entitlement coverage
- service material requisition lines validate warehouse availability before saving; serial-tracked items use an available-serial picker, and stock visibility opens from a compact modal trigger
- service handover invoice conversion supports fallback item mapping for expense lines and lets users choose estimate labor vs approved timesheet labor
- service job detail pages render a costing summary with estimate, invoice, material, direct-purchase, labor, and expense-claim breakdowns, including entitlement-adjusted labor billing visibility
- service job pages follow the current dense ERP layout rule: lists/status records appear before create forms, job tabs anchor to `#tab-content`, and add/create forms for jobs, daily sheets, operations, and MRNs are exposed through explicit on-demand controls
- service job overview is intentionally short: compact header, cockpit, process timeline, collapsed edit/intake sections; billing entitlement and closeout readiness live in the `Billing` tab
- finance chart-of-accounts pages now support account creation/edit/delete, parent account structure, and posting/group flags
- finance petty cash pages provide fund creation, editing, top-up, adjustment, and settlement-ledger visibility
- finance petty cash IOU pages track job-linked cash advances separately from final service expense-claim settlement
- audit logs now render structured field diffs with filters for technical rows and system-maintained fields instead of only dumping raw JSON
