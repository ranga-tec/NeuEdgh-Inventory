# Agent Handover: Service Job Daily Operations

## Current Status

This handover covers the service/job module work completed through:

`2e29358 Link service job closeout checks to workflows`

Local update on 2026-05-25:

- service handover invoice conversion now supports manual invoice lines without requiring an approved estimate
- manual conversion covers labour/work done, additional items, sundries/grease/lubricants, discount percent, and tax selection
- estimate-based conversion remains available when an approved service estimate should drive the invoice
- item category `SUNDRIES` is used for grease, lubricants, consumables, and similar service-repair charges
- warehouse bins/racks moved out of the warehouse master page into `Master Data -> Warehouse Bins`

Local update on 2026-05-26:

- Phase 1 of the service UX revision is implemented.
- Job `Expenses` now separates IOU advances, petty-cash expenses, and out-of-pocket claims.
- Job-linked IOUs and claims remain visible on the job page after creation.
- IOU creation confirms the generated IOU number and pending finance approval state.
- Daily progress history appears before the add-progress form.
- Daily sheet rows expose quick links for labour, progress, material issue, IOU request, and expense entry.
- Phase 2 cockpit work is also implemented: job detail now shows summary metrics and a process timeline above the tab navigation.

Local update on 2026-05-27:

- Phase 3 of the service UX revision is implemented.
- `Daily Work -> Daily Sheets` now shows daily cards instead of a plain row/table-first view.
- Each daily card shows planned work, completed work, pending/issues, latest progress, staff preview, and counts for staff, progress, MRNs, returns, expenses, and IOUs.
- Daily cards link directly to staff/labour, progress, materials, IOU request, and expense entry while the focused sub-tabs remain the detailed entry surfaces.
- Phase 4 command center is implemented at `Service -> Command Center`.
- Backend endpoint `GET /api/service/jobs/dashboard` powers service workload metrics, stage/status bars, active job cards, finance queue, and billing/closeout queue.
- Phase 5 dispatch/technician workspace is implemented.
- Backend endpoints `GET /api/service/jobs/dispatch-board` and `GET /api/service/jobs/technician-workbench` power `Service -> Dispatch Board` and `Service -> Technician Workbench`.
- Dispatch Board shows unassigned, assigned/active, waiting, and completed job lanes.
- Technician Workbench shows today's assignments, open daily sheets, active jobs, and quick links for progress, materials, IOUs, and expenses.

Local update on 2026-06-04:

- Full UI/UX expert review and revamp of the Job Order module was conducted using Playwright browser automation (screenshots verified at 1440×900 viewport).
- `AppFormModal` client component (`frontend/src/components/AppFormModal.tsx`) was added. All create/edit forms across the job order module now open in focused modal dialogs without navigating away from the current page.
- Forms converted to modal: Create New Job Order, Edit Job Header, Add Operation/Sub-Part, Add Daily Field Sheet, Create First Daily Sheet, Add Staff/Labor, Add Progress Update, Request IOU/Advance, Create Petty Cash Voucher, Create Reimbursement Claim, Edit Job from list row.
- Production build was rebuilt (`npm run build --webpack`) and redeployed locally. All CSS hashes are consistent. The `next start` server on port 3000 was restarted and verified healthy.
- User manual (`docs/job-orders-user-manual.md`) was fully rewritten to reflect the modal-based UI, viewport-fit overview, Process Timeline navigation, and the new empty-state CTAs.
- Agent handover document and next-session notes updated to reflect this session's changes.
- Playwright test scripts (used during this session) are untracked and should be cleaned up or .gitignored:
  - `frontend/iss_pw*.cjs`

Local update on 2026-06-13:

- Daily sheet PDF/service report is implemented.
- Backend route added: `GET /api/service/jobs/{id}/daily-sheets/{dailySheetId}/pdf`.
- PDF renderer added under the existing `IDocumentPdfService` / QuestPDF pipeline as `PdfDocumentType.ServiceJobDailySheet`.
- The report includes the daily sheet header, planned/completed/pending work, problems/instructions/notes, staff/labor, progress updates, material issues, returns/damage/supplier rejection, IOUs, and expense claims.
- Job daily sheet cards now expose a `Service report PDF` link.
- First user access-level and in-app notification slice is implemented for petty-cash IOUs.
- Added persistent user permission overrides plus Admin -> Users access settings. Role defaults still preserve existing Finance/Service behavior unless Admin saves explicit permissions.
- Added in-app user notifications with unread count, a header `Notifications` entry, `/notifications` page, and mark-read actions.
- IOU endpoint permissions now cover view/create/submit/approve/reject/release/settle. When an IOU is submitted, all active users with approve or release rights receive an in-app notification. Requesters receive notifications when the IOU is approved, rejected, released, or settled.
- Migration added: `20260613161955_AddUserPermissionsAndUserNotifications`.

Local update on 2026-05-31:

- Job Order list UX was revised so the job list is the primary first screen. `+ New Job Order` links to the create form at the bottom of the page, behind a clear `+ Create New Job Order` details section.
- Job detail header was compacted to keep the first viewport usable: breadcrumb, job number, status/type badges, essential meta, PDF, and workflow actions are inline; date-heavy details are hidden behind `Show dates & details`.
- Job tab links, cockpit links, process-timeline links, daily-work links, material links, and expense links now append `#tab-content` so users land directly at the tab/work area.
- The `Overview` tab was decluttered to fit the cockpit and full process timeline in one normal desktop viewport. Billing entitlement, closeout readiness, and final invoice work now belong to the `Billing` tab.
- The separate `Next Actions` panel was removed. The process timeline is the main guided workflow surface.
- `Daily Work -> Staff / Labor` and `Daily Work -> Progress` no longer show disabled forms when there is no selected daily sheet. They show a no-sheet empty state and a single `Go to Daily Sheets` action.
- `Daily Work -> Daily Sheets` now has a stronger empty state with `+ Create First Daily Sheet`; when sheets exist, `+ Add Another Day` appears in the card header.
- `Plan` and `Materials` add/create forms are now obvious on-demand rows (`+ Add Operation`, `+ New MRN`) while the current table/list remains primary.

## User Requirement

The user clarified that the system must replace paper books/notes during real job execution.

The required practical workflow is:

1. Open a service job.
2. While the job is running, create a daily field/job sheet for each working day or site visit.
3. Record daily technicians/workers, progress, petty-cash advances, IOUs, out-of-pocket expenses, material issues, lubricants, consumables, returns, damages, rejected parts, and supplier-return impacts.
4. Show ongoing job costs while the job is still open.
5. Block closeout until daily records, IOUs, expenses, labor, materials, returns, and invoice decisions are resolved.

The user also clarified after implementation:

- The job detail page must not show every service workflow form as one long page.
- Service jobs now use top-level workflow tabs:
  - `Overview`
  - `Plan`
  - `Daily Work`
  - `Materials`
  - `Expenses`
  - `Billing`
  - `Costs`
  - `Files & Notes`
- `Daily Work` now uses sub-tabs:
  - `Daily Sheets`
  - `Staff / Labor`
  - `Progress`
- Closeout readiness tiles are clickable and route users to the relevant tab/sub-tab or supporting module.
- Newer job links append `#tab-content` so stage/tile clicks focus the actual working tab instead of the top of the long page.
- The current design rule is: primary data and status must appear before create forms; create/add forms should be opened on demand and must not hide existing records below the fold.

## Industry/Standard Pattern Used

The implemented direction follows common field-service ERP practice:

- Field technicians update work orders and submit service reports during the job.
- Expenses are linked to work orders/jobs.
- Job costing combines labor, materials, expenses, and returns while the job is in progress.
- Field inventory includes issued parts and returns of unused, excess, defective, damaged, or wrong parts.

References already documented in `docs/service-job-daily-field-operations-requirement.md`:

- Salesforce Field Service pricing/features: technician users can view/update work orders, create quotes, and submit service reports from the field.
- Salesforce Field Service expenses: expenses are associated with work orders.
- Simpro job costing: job cost should track materials, labor, contractors, equipment, overhead, and live profitability.
- Oracle field service parts returns: technicians return excess, unused, and defective parts to warehouse/return destinations.

## Completed Backend Work

### Service Job Operations / Sub-Parts Plan

Added:

- `backend/src/ISS.Domain/Service/ServiceJobOperation.cs`
- EF mapping and migration for service job operations
- API endpoints under `ServiceJobsController`
- service methods in `ServiceManagementService`

Operation fields:

- step number / sequence
- work step / subassembly name
- description
- planned item/sub-part
- planned quantity
- estimated labor hours
- required date
- notes
- status: planned, in progress, completed, skipped

The operation plan is only a plan. Inventory is still consumed through MRN posting, and labor actuals still come from approved labor/time records.

### Daily Sheet Entity

Added:

- `backend/src/ISS.Domain/Service/ServiceJobDailySheet.cs`

Daily sheet fields:

- number
- service job
- sheet date
- prepared by
- site/location
- shift
- weather/site condition
- planned work
- completed work
- pending work
- problems found
- customer instructions
- technician notes
- supervisor notes
- status

Statuses:

- `Draft`
- `Submitted`
- `Approved`
- `Rejected`

### Daily Sheet Links Added

Existing records now optionally link to `ServiceJobDailySheetId`:

- `ServiceJobAssignment`
- `ServiceJobProgressUpdate`
- `PettyCashIou`
- `ServiceExpenseClaim`
- `MaterialRequisition`
- `ServiceJobMaterialDisposition`

This allows each daily sheet to show staff/progress/material/return/expense/IOU counts.

### Service Methods Added/Changed

In `ServiceManagementService`:

- create daily sheet
- submit daily sheet
- approve daily sheet
- reject daily sheet
- validate daily sheet belongs to job before linking entries
- prevent adding new entries to approved daily sheets
- closeout readiness now blocks open `Draft` or `Submitted` daily sheets

Existing create methods were extended with optional `ServiceJobDailySheetId`:

- assignment creation
- progress update creation
- material requisition creation
- material disposition creation
- service expense claim creation

In `FinanceService`:

- `CreatePettyCashIouAsync` accepts optional `ServiceJobDailySheetId`
- validates daily sheet belongs to the service job
- prevents adding IOUs to approved daily sheets

### API Changes

Updated service job API:

- `GET /api/service/jobs/{id}/daily-sheets`
- `POST /api/service/jobs/{id}/daily-sheets`
- `POST /api/service/jobs/{id}/daily-sheets/{dailySheetId}/submit`
- `POST /api/service/jobs/{id}/daily-sheets/{dailySheetId}/approve`
- `POST /api/service/jobs/{id}/daily-sheets/{dailySheetId}/reject`

Updated existing APIs to carry optional daily sheet IDs:

- service job assignment
- service job progress update
- material requisition
- material disposition
- service expense claim
- petty cash IOU

### Database Migration

Added migration:

- `backend/src/ISS.Infrastructure/Persistence/Migrations/20260514163425_AddServiceJobDailySheets.cs`
- designer file
- updated `IssDbContextModelSnapshot.cs`

  - `Step No.`
  - `Work step / subassembly`
- planned work steps can carry a planned part/sub-part, quantity, estimated labor hours, required date, description, and notes
- operation actions allow start/complete/skip as applicable

Daily Work:

- added `Daily Field Sheets` section
- added create form for daily sheets
- added submit/approve/reject actions
- added daily sheet counts for:

## Recommended Next Agent Steps

1. Treat `origin/main` at the latest pushed commit as the baseline.
2. Preserve unrelated local worktree changes (finance, sidebar, work-orders) unless the user explicitly asks to stage or revert them.
3. Clean up untracked Playwright test scripts left in `frontend/`:
   - `frontend/iss_pw*.cjs`
   - Either delete them or add to `.gitignore`
4. Continue with remaining reporting/PDF/accounting refinements, especially:
   - pending closeout report
   - IOU/employee advance report per employee and per job
   - material issued/returned/damaged report
   - partial IOU settlement details (amount spent, cash returned, extra reimbursement)
   - bill/attachment upload per expense line or daily sheet
5. Finance pending:
   - expense category master for structured expense line classification
   - approval role checks for finance supervisor vs service supervisor
   - stronger audit trail/reporting for employee advances and reimbursement balances
6. Infrastructure:
   - add a `next start` process manager or startup script so production server (port 3000) survives reboots without manual intervention
7. Run targeted checks for service-job work:
   - `dotnet test backend\tests\ISS.UnitTests\ISS.UnitTests.csproj`
   - `dotnet build backend\src\ISS.Api\ISS.Api.csproj`
   - `npx tsc --noEmit` from `frontend/`
8. Push with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` if the Windows Git credential manager hangs.
9. Deploy to Railway from a clean detached worktree using:
   - `npx @railway/cli@latest up --service ERP --environment production --detach`
10. Verify `/login`, job detail tabs, and daily-work deep links after deploy.
