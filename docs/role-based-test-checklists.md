# ISS Role-Based Test Checklists

This document provides manual test checklists for these user roles:

- `Admin`
- `Procurement`
- `Sales`
- `Finance`
- `Service`

It is intended for UAT, regression testing, and user training.

Validated against the current backend authorization attributes on March 30, 2026.

## How To Use This Document

1. Create one test user per role.
2. Give each user only the single role being tested.
3. Use a prepared baseline dataset so the role user can focus on business actions instead of system setup.
4. Test both:
   - what the role should be able to do
   - what the role should not be able to do

Important note:

- the frontend sidebar is broadly shared
- backend API authorization is the true enforcement layer
- a restricted user may still see some links, but they must not be able to successfully use restricted pages or actions

## Baseline Data To Prepare Before Role Testing

Prepare this once using an `Admin` user:

- at least one warehouse
- at least one item and UoM
- one supplier
- one customer
- default currencies
- default payment types
- default tax codes
- default reference forms

| --- | --- |
| Warehouse | `MAIN` |
| Supplier | `SUP1` |
| Customer | `CUS1` |
| Item | `SKU1 - Hydraulic Filter` |
| UoM | `PCS` |
