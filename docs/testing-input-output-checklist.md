# ISS Testing Input / Output Checklist

This document gives testers exact values to enter, expected outputs, and where to verify each result.

Use it for manual UAT, demo database testing, and regression checks after deployments. Run the scenario as an `Admin` user first. Role-by-role testing can be done later using `docs/role-based-test-checklists.md`.

For a standalone Service Job section QA run covering jobs, daily sheets, labour, materials, material returns, petty cash, IOUs, accounts, invoices, closeout, and reporting, use `docs/service-job-section-testing-document.md`.

## Recent Workflow Notes

### Service Job Materials

The service job `Materials` tab is now split into three working views:

| View | Purpose | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Issued MRNs` | Show posted material issues for the job | MRNs are grouped by MRN number, show the daily sheet number when linked, and expand to show issued item lines |
| `Return Materials` | Draft and post not-needed, wrongly-issued, or supplier-rejected returns | Drafts do not update stock; posting receives returnable stock back to the job warehouse |
| `Damage Material` | Draft and post damaged/unusable material declarations | Posting records the damage disposition but does not receive usable stock |

Important expected behavior:

- Creating an MRN still opens the material requisition document where users add lines and post the issue.
- Posted MRNs are the source of issued item visibility for the job.
- Material returns and damage records are created as drafts first.
- Draft material returns and damage rows can be edited or voided before posting.
- Only posted material return rows affect inventory.
- Damaged material does not increase usable stock.

### Service Job Completion Safety

The service job `Complete` action now requires typed confirmation.

| Action | Expected safeguard |
| --- | --- |
| Click `Complete` on a service job | Dialog opens |
| Type anything other than `COMPLETE` | `Complete Job` remains disabled |
| Type `COMPLETE` | `Complete Job` becomes enabled |

### Local Performance Smoke Test Baseline

A local developer-machine smoke test was run on 2026-05-21 using the dev API and Next dev server. Treat these as rough diagnostics, not production capacity numbers.

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| API health | `200 Healthy` |
| Slowest API average | Login around `796ms`; service job costing around `383ms` |
| 20 parallel service costing requests | `20/20` succeeded |
| Slowest frontend dev pages | Items, service job materials, service jobs, sales invoices |

Recommended performance follow-up:

- Measure again with `next build` and `next start`.
- Consider a combined service-job detail API if job detail page latency becomes a production issue.
- Watch `service/jobs/{id}/costing`, `items/options`, and report endpoints as data volume grows.

## 1. Reset Test Data

Use this only on a test database.

Go to `Admin -> Testing Cleanup`.

Type:

| Field | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Confirmation | `CLEAR` |

Recommended reset before this full test:

1. Click `Clear PO`
2. Type `CLEAR` again
3. Click `Clear Jobs / Service`
4. Type `CLEAR` again
5. Click `Zero Stock`

Expected:

| Check | Where | Expected output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cleanup response | Same page | Success message after each button |
| Inventory reset | `Inventory -> Inventory Availability`, click `Load inventory` | No inventory rows |
| PO/GRN reset | `Procurement -> Purchase Orders`, `Procurement -> Goods Receipts` | No old test PO/GRN documents, unless the database has unrelated retained data |
| Service reset | `Service -> Jobs`, `Finance -> Petty Cash IOUs` | No old test jobs, daily sheets, job-linked IOUs, service expenses, MRNs, material dispositions, work orders, QC, or handovers |

Do not use cleanup buttons on real production data.

## 10. Service Job / Servicing Full Workflow

Start this section after completing the partial GRN tests in sections 3.2 and 3.3. At that point stock should already contain `SKU-CORE = 20`, `SKU-BATCH = 10` in batch `LOT-A`, and serials `SER-001` / `SER-002` in `MAIN`. If you also completed sections 5 through 9, use the lower balances shown there.

This section is the full service-job test. It must prove that the job can be opened, planned, started, executed through daily work records, issued with materials, updated by technicians/supervisors, costed, billed or marked not billable, closed, and audited afterward.

Use this interpretation while testing:

| Job area | Meaning | Who normally owns it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Overview` | Job header, intake, customer/equipment, entitlement, closeout readiness links | service supervisor / service coordinator |
| `Plan` | Intended work stages before or during repair. `Sequence` means execution order, such as `10`, `20`, `30`. `Operation / subassembly` means the work step or equipment area, such as `Diagnose starting system` or `Fuel pump assembly`. Planned parts here are only expected parts; they do not reduce stock. | service supervisor / workshop lead |
| `Daily Work -> Daily Sheets` | The daily job card. Planned work is what the team expects to do that day; completed/pending/problems are the daily field record. | supervisor / job card preparer |
| `Daily Work -> Staff / Labor` | People assigned to the job for that day. Link to a daily sheet when the work belongs to a specific day. | supervisor / timekeeper |
| `Daily Work -> Progress` | Actual progress notes from technicians or supervisors: work done, pending work, problems, customer instructions, and site issues. | technician / supervisor |
| `Materials` | MRN creation, material issue, and used/unused/damaged/rejected material disposition. | stores / service supervisor |
| `Expenses` | IOUs, petty-cash spending, and out-of-pocket claims linked to the job and optionally to a daily sheet. | technician / finance / supervisor |
| `Billing` | quotation/invoice trail, closeout readiness, and final invoice decision. | service coordinator / finance |
| `Costs` | Actual cost, quoted revenue, invoice revenue, margin view, and source tables. | supervisor / finance |
| `Files & Notes` | Comments, attachments, and supporting evidence. | all authorized job users |

Professional service systems normally avoid one long job form. In ISS, testers should confirm the job detail behaves as a workspace with tabs and sub-tabs, and that pending closeout tiles open the related data list or workflow area instead of leaving the user to search manually.

### 10.1 Create Equipment And Job

Go to `Service -> Equipment Units`.

Create equipment unit:

| --- | --- |
| `Overview` | compact cockpit, process timeline, collapsed edit job, collapsed job intake |
| `Plan` | `Job Operations / Sub-Parts Plan`, operations table, and visible `+ Add Operation` modal action |
| `Daily Work` | sub-tabs for `Daily Sheets`, `Staff / Labor`, and `Progress`; daily sheets show first, create forms open in modal dialogs |

## 15. Final Reconciliation

After all sections above:

| Area | Where | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SKU-CORE` stock | `Inventory -> Inventory Availability` | MAIN `8`, SEC `5`, total `13` after unused service material return |
| `SKU-BATCH` stock | Availability search `LOT-A` | MAIN `10`, batch `LOT-A` |

| Supplier AP | `Finance -> AP` | GRN/AP entries cleared if payment allocated |
| Service job costing | Job detail, `Costs` tab | material issue `35`, labor cost `20`, expense `5`, material dispositions clear, plus invoice/estimate values from service flow |

## 16. Common Failures And Where To Look

| Problem | Check |
| --- | --- |
| GRN cannot post | Confirm PO is approved and receipt quantity does not exceed remaining quantity |
| Batch item cannot save | Confirm batch/lot is entered for `SKU-BATCH` |
| Serial item cannot save | Confirm serial count equals quantity and serials are unique |
| MRN says insufficient stock | Check `Inventory -> Inventory Availability` for the source warehouse |
| MRN serial not listed | Serial may already be consumed or not received into that warehouse |
| Stock value does not match | Check `Reporting -> Stock Ledger` movement quantities and unit costs |
| AP/AR does not clear | Confirm payment allocation is saved against the correct outstanding entry |
| Service estimate billing differs from raw total | Check warranty/contract entitlement on the job; covered labor/parts can bill at zero |
| Job cannot close | Open job detail `Overview` or `Billing` tab -> `Closeout Readiness`; clear the listed pending item such as material disposition, IOU, expense claim, job sheet / work order, labor entry, or final invoice decision |
| Returned service material not back in stock | Confirm the return draft was posted from `Materials -> Return Materials`; `Damaged - do not return to usable stock` does not add warehouse stock |
## Recent Workflow Updates

### Service Material Returns

- Job material issue/MRN continues to consume inventory when the MRN is posted.
- Material return/disposition is now for exceptions only: not needed returns, wrongly issued returns, damaged material, and rejected/supplier-return material.
- Creating a material return/disposition line saves a draft only. Drafts can be edited or voided without touching stock.
- Posting a material return/disposition updates inventory only for returnable outcomes:
  - Not needed returned: receipt back to the job warehouse.
  - Wrongly issued returned: receipt back to the job warehouse.
  - Rejected/supplier return: receipt back to the job warehouse so a supplier return can issue it out through procurement.
  - Damaged: no usable-stock receipt.
- Existing active material disposition records from the old immediate-post workflow are migrated as posted records.

### Equipment Warranty Entry

- Equipment creation and edit forms now allow selecting warranty coverage without the control appearing locked.
- Warranty coverage and warranty end date must be provided together.
- Entering a warranty end date auto-selects the standard labor-and-parts coverage when coverage is still set to no warranty.

### Finance Credit Notes

- Credit notes are split in the UI into A/R Credit Notes for customer-side credits and A/P Credit Notes for supplier-side credits.
- The backend still stores both in the shared credit note model, but user navigation follows standard ERP terminology.
- Customer returns create customer-side A/R credit notes. Supplier returns create supplier-side A/P credit notes.

### Sales Invoice Source Creation

- Sales invoice creation can now start from a posted AOD/dispatch or direct dispatch.
- Invoice lines are copied from the selected source document instead of being re-entered manually.

### Customer Returns

- Customer return invoice selection excludes draft invoices.
- When a customer return references an invoice, return line item selection is restricted to items on that invoice.
- Returns without an invoice can still select any item.
- The standalone stock visibility selector was removed from customer return detail to avoid a duplicate item-entry UI; stock context remains inside the add-line workflow.
